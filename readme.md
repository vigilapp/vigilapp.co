# Vigil

Vigil is crowdsourced security and emergency response. We're all cops now.

## Overview

To set up the _virtual_ development environment, you'll need to install and configure [Composer](http://laravel.com/docs/5.0/installation) and [Homestead](http://laravel.com/docs/5.0/homestead). There are a few other documented dependencies too, but it's not bad.
